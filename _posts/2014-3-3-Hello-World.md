## MY JOURNEY ON THE ROAD TO CYBERSECURITY

Welcome! This is a simple website designed to share my journey into Information Security. The reality is that "Cybersecurity" has become a buzz word. What does Cybersecurity even mean? Did Cybersecurity exist before the term was coined? Finally, what does it take to get into the field of Cybersecurity? 

I hope throughout documenting my journey I can share with you the truth concerning those questions. While everyone's journey is different, my goal is to give you not only my experiences with learning, but to make sure I am brutally honest about these questions. 

This site is a work in progress and will be a mix of blog posts, tutorials, projects, and my insight concerning Cybersecurity. If you have any questions please send me an email and I will try to answer those questions to the best of my ability.
